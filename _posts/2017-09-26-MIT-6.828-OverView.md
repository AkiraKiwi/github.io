## Description

* 6.828 是 MIT 的操作系统工程这门课的课程编号，同时 MIT 还开发了一个用于教学的操作系统 xv6 (x86处理器上(x即指x86)用ANSI标准C重新实现的Unix第六版(Unix V6，通常直接被称为V6))。<br>

* [schedule](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2017/schedule.html)<br>


## 6.828 goals

* Understand operating systems in detail by designing and implementing a small O/S <br>
* Hands-on experience with building systems  ("Applying 6.033") <br>

## What do applications want from an O/S?

* Abstract the hardware for convenience and portability<br>
* Multiplex the hardware among multiple applications<br>
* Isolate applications to contain bugs<br>
* Allow sharing among applications<br>

## What is an OS?

* e.g. OSX, Windows, Linux<br>
* the small view: a h/w management library<br>
* the big view: physical machine -> abstract one w/ better properties<br>

## Organization: layered picture
* h/w: CPU, mem, disk<br>
* kernel: [various services]<br>
* user: applications, e.g. vi and gcc<br>
* we care a lot about the interfaces and internel kernel structure<br>

## What services does an O/S kernel typically provide?
* processes<br>
* memory<br>
* file contents<br>
* directories and file names<br>
* security<br>
* many others: users, IPC, network, time, terminals<br>

## What does an O/S abstraction look like?
* Applications only see them via system calls<br>
* Examples, from UNIX / Linux:<br>
	```c
	fd = open("out", 1);
	write(fd, "hello\n", 6);
	pid = fork();
	```

## Why is O/S design/implementation hard/interesting?
* the environment is unforgiving: weird h/w, no debugger<br>
* it must be efficient (thus low-level?)<br>
	...but abstract/portable (thus high-level?)<br>
* powerful (thus many features?)<br>
	...but simple (thus a few composable building blocks?)<br>
* features interact: `fd = open(); ...; fork()`<br>
* behaviors interact: CPU priority vs memory allocator.<br>
* open problems: security, multi-core<br>
